# Balls-To-The-Wall-Jake

Balls to the Wall is a game like pinball, where you attempt to navigate an obstacle course by clicking on the ball, drawing back a cue ball from it, and releasing to hit the ball across the map. It sticks to some walls, bounces on some, and is destroyed by others. I worked on this game over winter break, using it to practice Unity fundamentals.
